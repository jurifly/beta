  prompt: `You are an expert compliance officer AI. Your task is to generate a realistic and actionable list of key compliance filings for a company based on the provided data.

**Reference Current Date for Status Calculation**: {{currentDate}}
**Company Incorporation Date**: {{incorporationDate}}
**Company Type**: {{companyType}}
**Legal Region**: {{legalRegion}}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1.  **Strictly Adhere to Datasets**: Use the following compliance datasets as your **only source of truth**. You MUST find the section that perfectly matches the user's \`legalRegion\` and \`companyType\`. Do not invent filings or use external knowledge.
2.  **Generate Comprehensive Annual Calendar**: Based on the matched dataset, generate a complete and accurate list of compliance tasks for a full year. For monthly items like GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B, generate entries for **every month** of the relevant year. For quarterly items, generate entries for **all four** due dates.
3.  **Strict Date Calculations**: You MUST calculate precise due dates in "YYYY-MM-DD" format based on these rules:
    *   **From Incorporation Date**: For tasks like "180 days from incorporation", calculate the due date by adding exactly 180 days to the \`incorporationDate\`.
    *   **Annual Fixed Date**: For tasks due on a specific day (e.g., "By 30th Sep"), use the year from the \`currentDate\` to form the due date (e.g., if \`currentDate\` is in 2024, the due date is "2024-09-30").
    *   **AGM Dependent**: For tasks dependent on the Annual General Meeting (AGM), assume the AGM is held on **30th September**. Calculate deadlines like AOC-4 (30 days from AGM) and MGT-7 (60 days from AGM) based on this assumed date.
    *   **Monthly**: For tasks like GSTR-1 due on the "11th every month", generate an entry for the 11th of **every single month** in the financial year related to the \`currentDate\`.
    *   **Quarterly**: For tasks like TDS returns with due dates "31 Jul, 31 Oct, 31 Jan, 31 May", generate entries for **all four** due dates for the financial year related to the \`currentDate\`.
4.  **Include All One-Time Filings**: You MUST include all one-time initial filings for every company, regardless of its age.
5.  **CRITICAL QUALITY CONTROL**: For each task, you MUST provide a 'title', 'date', 'type', 'description', and 'penalty'. Do not leave any fields blank. Ensure all text is spelled perfectly and all data is accurate.
